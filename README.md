## Things it MUST do

<ol type="1">
1. Receive input on how the user writes to serve as template
      <ul>
        <li>Possible implementation:</li>
      </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Have files with text written by the user</li>
                <li>If there are more than 1 file, write alg to concatenate them</li>
                <li>If no file is present, fallback to default instructions such as
                    <ul>
                        <li>Write an essay with x lines</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Label the text with theme, what the user was trying to imply, etc.
                    <ul>
                        <li>That information should be inside the text file with something to indicate it like some characters to surround it etc</li>
                        <li>I could use AI to parse the files and see what the user meant, wanted to write when the file doesnâ€™t have that stored, or even if it does, do it anyway for better prompt</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>What to do with that input file</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide to the AI call, as system instructions</li>
                <li>Tell it to analyze the writing pattern</li>
                <li>Maybe pass it to another assistant to highlight the writing patterns and only then send it to the main assistant</li>
            </ul>
  </ol>
